# DNA-sequence-organizer/FASTA splitter-
Organizes a single file containing many DNA sequences into separate text files by category or name, automatically sorting sequences so each file contains only the sequences that match a specific identifier.

I made this to assist the Tulane's Infectious Disease deparment.
